# 100 Days Of Code - Log
**This is round 2 for me with 100 Days of Code.**  This time I'm going to track my progress better by using this fork and by blogging about my progress.

**Why:** The last time I did this challenge was to learn more about customizing WordPress and to get started with Python.  While I didn't get to code everyday, I was successful at completing my goals.  So, I consider round 1 a success.

Although I'm a long time programmer, I realize that development technologies are progressing at a lightening pace.  As a way to keep up (or in some cases catch up), I am going to do the challenges at FreeCodeCamp.  (And probably a couple of courses on Udemy).

### Day 0: August 30, 2017

So, round 2 didn't start so well... first was Labor Day Weekend.  I didn't program over the holiday weekend.  Then I began preparing for Hurricane Irma, then the hurricane, then the cleanup.  So here we are at September 17 and I've only had two days of actual programming.

So, I'm going to start again.  Tomorrow, September 18, 2017 will be the new first day of Round 2 of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
